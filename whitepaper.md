1) Introduction  
Sayanjali Nexus (SYJ) is building a real-world utility ecosystem where blockchain enhances everyday commerce. Rooted in businesses spanning e-commerce, frozen foods, cloud kitchens, IT services and more, SYJ connects practical use cases with a transparent token economy. The SYJ Token underpins payments, loyalty, staking-based access, and governance on non-financial features—prioritizing utility while allowing optional trading at the holder’s discretion.
